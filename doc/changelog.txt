== 2.0 b3 (October 20, 2015) ==

Abilities:
- Alchemist Crafts: New ability to put crafts in for this class.
- Antiquarian Crafts: New ability to put crafts in for this class.
- Artificer Crafts: New ability to put crafts in for this class.
- Bloodsword: Fixed a rare issue where a vampire's level prevents him from using his own bloodsword.
- Butcher: No longer works on corpses bound to someone else.
- Cleanse: Changed how cleanse detects that an effect is a penalty (and thus can't be cleansed). Instead of a blacklist of affect types, it now considers something a penalty if it was cast by the person it is on.
- Confer: Now detects when the same effect is conferred by different people, and does not stack it or reset its duration if so.
- Crafting: Added a new player trait, Crafting level, which determines the level of all crafts (forge, sew, etc). This replaces total/composite level for this function.
- Disarm: People using caster weapons will now get a mana blast attack instead of a hit attack when disarmed.
- Disenchant: No longer works on items bound to other people.
- Disguise: You can no longer disguise while morphed, and morphing breaks disguise.
- Enchanting: Now uses the higher of your gear level or crafting level.
- Exarch Buildings: New ability to put buildings in for this class.
- Familiar: Now uses parent skill level (Natural Magic) to determine what you can summon again, instead of total skill level. Base Familiar ability now gives a giant tortoise tank. Moved griffin to a class familiar. Added familiars to each Natural Magic class; these don't require the base Familiar ability to use. Familiars now scale to 25 levels below the player (over level 125) and continue to scale up as the player levels up (but must be re-summoned to get a new level familiar).
- Firstaid: Fixed a bug where firstaid could not previously be used to remove a DoT effect if the target was at full health.
- Foresight: Fixed a bug where this ability did not gain experience while fighting NPCs.
- Guildsman Crafts: New ability to put crafts in for this class.
- Hide: No longer works in combat (used to work, but poorly).
- Mirror Image: Fixed how the mirror scales to the player like a familiar.
- Passive/triggered combat abilities: Doubled the experience gain on all the passive and triggered combat-round abilities and skills (such as Battle, Reflexes, Claws, Ready Fireball, etc.) which previously gave 1% or 2% experience gains (with bonus exp).
- Pickpocket: Stunned victims will no longer resist pickpocket in normal cases. Added a 50-levels-under limit to pickpocket. If the target is too far over your level, they'll even wake up to stop you.
- Portal Magic: This ability now also causes you to get only 4 minutes of portal sickness instead of 5.
- Reforge/renew: Will no longer use items on the ground in places you don't have permission to use.
- Smuggler Crafts: New ability to put crafts in for this class.
- Sneak: No longer sets off 'greet' triggers (but will still set off 'greet all' triggers).
- Soulmask: Selling the soulmask ability now shuts off its effect.
- Soulsight: Removed the command lag from this ability; it's now instant.
- Steal: You can no longer steal from a building which was ceded to an empire but never used by that empire.
- Steelsmith Crafts: New ability to put crafts in for this class.
- Summon Swift: Corrected the attack type on the stag and serpent from 'claw' to 'gore' and 'whip'.
- Tinker Crafts: New ability to put crafts in for this class.
- Workforce: Fixed a bug where incapacitated and sleeping mobs could perform Workforce chores.

Adventures:
- 100 Magiterranean: The Grove: Removed a duplicate trigger on one room template.
- 102 Magiterranean: Interdimensional Whirlwind: A new non-adventure that spawns fanciful crops on the map each month.
- 121 The Swamp Hag: Fixed a typo in the swamp rat combat trigger.
- 122 Ruins: Three Banditos: Changed how mobs spawn in this adventure to prevent empty adventures. This uses an item from adventure 123. Fixed a typo in a trigger name.
- 123 Ruins: Thieves: Changed how mobs spawn in this adventure to prevent empty adventures. Updated the loot for all thieves. Changed the level range to 25-75 (from 5-100). The mobs are no longer flagged HARD. Raised the vnum cap on the adventure to make room for future updates and for the new spawner items. This low-level adventure now shows up on 'nearby'.
- 126 Mountain Cave: Flame Dragon: A new map-based adventure for levels 100-150.
- 127 Abandoned Dragon Nest: A new adventure that spawns a 125-175 dragon on the map.
- 140 The Sewer: Ratskins: Added two exit triggers from zone 141 to make the sewer exit slightly easier to use.
- 141 The Sewer: Goblin Outpost: A new adventure zone that sells unique new crafting patterns and buildings. It also provides a level 50-100 solo combat adventure.
- 281 Mountain Valley: Molten Fiend: Reduced the area and spam on the world announcement. It is no longer possible to flee from the fiend.
- 282 Goblin Logging Camp: A new low-level, map-based resource/flavor adventure.
- Cooking fire: Added a flag that lets adventure rooms have cooking fires.
- First mob healing: Fixed a bug where lock-level-on-combat adventures locked AFTER the first hit if you opened combat with an ability instead of a normal attack, causing the mob to heal after the first damage. Adventures now lock on damage, not just hit.
- Instancer: Changed the order of some of the room validator checks to reduce work. The instancer also now purges mobs when spawning an instance. Improved how the instancer chooses locations when it has unusual constraints, such as "a road, only in a city". It now also chooses a linking rule at random and attempts it. Code related to instance-spawning was reworked for this. Will no longer link instances to incomplete buildings.
- Look out: Flagged many adventure buildings and rooms so players can use "look out" to see outside of them.
- Newbies: Added a configurable maximum min-level for adventures that can spawn on newbie islands (default: 25). Also adding !NEWBIE and NEWBIE-ONLY adventure flags.
- Pigeon post: Added a flag that lets adventure rooms function as post offices.
- Unclaimable: This flag no longer prevents adventures from spawning.
- Various: Fixed small scripting issues.

Books:
- Bookedit: Completely replaced the book editor with an interface that doesn't take the player out of the game, using the OLC system.
- OLC: Added an immortal book editor.

Buildings:
- Astral Nexus: A new building that can be used to summon players.
- Bridges: You can now build other buildings facing bridges. You cannot dismantle a bridge while it is the entrance for another building. This also applies to any other open buildings that are built on water.
- Building flags: Added a summon-players building flag for buildings that allow players to summon each other.
- City Centers: The game will now automatically remove city center buildings if they become abandoned. The game will also now audit for bad city centers at startup.
- Docks: Can no longer be built facing player-made water tiles.
- Flooded Ruins: Added the missing dismantle craft for this ruins type.
- Look out: Flagged many buildings and designated rooms so players can use "look out" to see the map from inside them.
- Oasis: Now counts as an "open building" for the purposes of things built facing open buildings.
- Portals: Building a portal now requires 20 nexus crystals, in addition to the other materials. You can no longer enter a portal if you the other end of it is owned by someone else (and not public) so that you can't enter a portal if you wouldn't be able to return from the other side. As before, you can get around this restriction by following a member of the empire, or by having Infiltrate.
- Roads: Unclaimed roads now decay over time. Roads still do not require maintenance.
- Ruins: Buildings built on water now have their own ruins type.
- Trenches: Unfinished trenches will now lose progress each year until they collapse completely.
- Tunnel: Fixed an issue where starting a tunnel did not add it to an empire's territory list, so workforce wouldn't spawn to build it until another tile was claimed or abandoned.

Cities:
- City claim: Now correctly checks corner boundaries. Also now supports an "all" argument after the city name/number in order to claim all tiles, not just built tiles.
- Delay time: Cities now have a delay until they count as cities for certain buildings, abilities, and other systems. This is controlled by the config "minutes_to_full_city", with a default of 60 minutes. Many uses of find_city() and IS_IN_CITY() were replaced by is_in_city_for_empire().
- Find-by-name: Added a preference for exact matches (over abbreviations) to the find-city-by-name lookup. This fixed a bug where it was possible to pick the wrong city if one city's name is an abbreviation of another.
- In-city: Changed the COUNTS-AS-CITY flag to LARGE-CITY-RADIUS. Instead of a building or road counting as in-city anywhere in the game, they now count as in-city when within 3x the normal city radius.
- Newbie islands: Players can no longer found cities on newbie islands (this is configurable).

Classes:
- Utility: Added the 'utility' class role to Empire and Trade classes, in part so that people who are non-combat characters aren't sorted with other class roles on the 'who' list. It will also allow crafters and leaders to be more apparent.

Code updates:
- Converter: Added a b2.x ->b3.0 playerfile converter.
- Global tables: Added new global data tables. These are currently used for global mob interactions, but will support additional uses. These reside in the lib/world/glb/ directory.
- Permissions: Split the can_use_room() function out so that it can be checked with an empire rather than just a character, in the form of emp_can_use_room().
- Pickpocket: All pickpocket data is now controlled by mob interactions.
- Scripting: Cleaned up the char/obj/room script variable parser, especially the room directions.
- Slow IP lookups: Added the ability to do partial matches on IP addresses in the "slow_nameserver_ips" list.
- Version Checking: EmpireMUD now stores the version of its last full startup, and uses this to detect new versions and automatically apply updates to the game.
- appear(): This function now attempts to remove affects that are causing hide/invisible instead of merely removing the affect flags.

Combat:
- Auto-assist: Fixed a bug where characters could auto-assist while feeding from (or being fed on by) other characters. Stunned, staked, or tied-up characters will no longer try to auto-assist.
- Mana blast: A new attack type used primarily by disarmed casters. It has the same speed as the basic "hit", but is a magical attack and uses Intelligence instead of Strength.
- Slow death: Fixed a bug where players who were at 0 HP but had no health regen (usually due to hunger/thirst) would neither heal nor die. Now they will die.

Commands:
- Accept: A new command for accepting generic offers, or listing offers.
- Adventure: Added a new function, 'adventure summon', to the adventure command. Players who are summoned to adventures will be returned to their previous location if they leave for any reason (unless they trinket or teleport away).
- Alternate: You can no longer alternate while snooping or OLC-editing. Alternate also no longer updates the reply-to info for other players (it still keeps your own reply-to).
- Bite: Staked or injured victims no longer resist bite.
- Catapult: Can now use rocks from the ground so long as you have permission to use the room they're in.
- Cede: Now only targets players, not NPCs.
- Circle: Fixed a bug where NPCs were requiring and using movement points for "circle"; they normally do not use move points to move.
- Crafting: Various craft commands will now work in rooms you don't otherwise have permission to use, but you won't be able to use items on the ground.
- Dig: When you finish depleting a room using dig, it will now tell you so instead of stopping silently. Will no longer find clay in quarries.
- Dismantle: Rearranged error messages to make no sense when a permissions error and a nodismantle error happen at the same time.
- Drop: Having an undroppable bound item will no longer stop further items during a "drop all".
- Enter: Charmed followers can no longer be ordered to enter a portal and leave their master. Entering player-created portals now causes portal sickness. You can portal again if you have 1 minute or less remaining on the portal sickness cooldown. It causes 1 minute if you have no portal sickness already, or 5 minutes if you already have portal sickness. You get 2 minutes instead of 5 if the portal is city-to-city.
- Fill: No longer requires the 2nd argument of "water" or "river"; it will check those automatically if you are somewhere that provides water and omit the second argument.
- Helpsearch: No longer doubles a dollar sign ($) in the user argument.
- Herd: Changed the error message received when you try to herd animals inside adventures to "You can't herd anything in an adventure." Fixed a bug where herding a mob you are following resulted in moving past it.
- Home set: Fixed a bug where setting a building as your home, when it was already someone else's home, caused additional chests to appear. You can no longer home-set while adventure-summoned.
- Home: Improved the error message if you try to home-set a home that is already yours.
- Islands: New command to see what islands your empire has territory on.
- Load (boat): Display an error if there was nothing to load.
- Look: Added "look out", which allows you to see the map from certain interior rooms. Immortals can use this from any room to see the surrounding map.
- Maintain: Changed the order of the error messages so you can't use it to determine if another empire's buildings require maintenance.
- Movement: Fixed a bug where it was sometimes possible to walk away in combat, after killing one of multiple enemies. Removed the movement delay when indoors, which was inadvertently added in a beta 1 patch.
- Nearby: Now able to be prevented by the !LOCATION room template flag.
- Pan: A pan tool now works from either hand.
- Portal: Portaling no longer costs nexus crystals. Instead, there is a 50-tile limit if both ends are not in a city. The "all" portal list will only show portals in range. The normal portal list will indicate if portals are out of range.
- Quarry: Now checks that you can still quarry each tick, so quitting and re-entering the game does not allow you to quarry a block from a dismantled quarry.
- Read: Added an explicit error message for read with no argument.
- Reject: A new command for rejecting generic offers.
- Retrieve: Fixed the error message when you don't have permission to withdraw.
- Ride: When attempting to ride in bat form, now gives the morph error message instead of the flying error message, as this makes more sense.
- Roll: Added a 1000-dice-at-a-time cap.
- Roster: Now indicates class role via color or text.
- Sacrifice: Can no longer be used on items that are bound to someone else.
- Sail: Now starts/stops sailing, instead of being spammed to sail.
- Scan: This command can now target nearby tiles by name, rather than just scanning directions.
- Ship: Added a new system for scheduling and shipping goods between islands. It requires docks on both islands, plus a ship to move between them. Shipping time is based on distance, and ships arrive/leave at 7am and 7pm.
- Sire: Improved the error message when trying to sire a vampire.
- Skin: Can no longer be used on corpses that are bound to someone else.
- Socials: You can no longer use socials while stunned, staked, or tied.
- Summon player: A new command that allows two players to summon a third, to an Astral Nexus.
- Summon: Now scales the summoned npc like a familiar.
- Tavern: Using the tavern command in an incomplete tavern will now function like using it outside of a tavern, instead of letting you change the tavern type.
- Throw: Can no longer be used in animal form. Can no longer throw bound items onto territory owned by others.
- Tie/Untie: These no longer work on players who are already dead.
- Toggle: Added mutual exclusions to the political, informative, and map-color toggles. Turning on any one of those (or turning off, in the case of map-color) should turn off the others.
- Tomb: You can no longer tomb-set while adventure-summoned.
- Tunnel: The open ends of tunnels may now face roads and open buildings.
- Unload: Will now tell you if the boat was empty.
- Where: The mortal version of this command will now find the closest valid match, and will no longer find characters you can't see. It will also now show the direction and distance to the target. Where will not locate characters who are in a !NEARBY-flagged adventure unless you are also in that adventure. It will also not work into or out of an adventure room with the !LOCATION flag.

Config changes:
- Changed default: max_map_size 12

- New: allow_extended_color_codes 0
- New: cities_on_newbie_islands 0
- New: hiring_builders 0
- New: hiring_coders 0
- New: max_capitals_in_name 2
- New: max_out_of_city_portal 50
- New: minutes_to_full_city 60

- New: newbie_adventure_cap 25
- New: offer_time 75
- New: redesignate_time 60
- Removed: auto_balance_per_cycle
- Strings: Can now be empty without losing the variable.

Crafts:
- Required level: Crafts can now have a level requirement.

Displays:
- Aliases: No longer parsing color codes on the alias list.
- Bug/idea/typo: The syslog from these commands now shows color codes instead of parsing them.
- City list: Now shows what island the city is on.
- Class role: The roles on the 'class' command are now colored, and your current role is indicated.
- Colors: Added 7 additional basic colors: azure, jade, lime, orange, tan, pink, and violet. Rewrote the code that reduces color codes sent to the client. It now more reliably removes color codes that wouldn't be displayed before sending an overriding color code. It also now handles background colors and underlines correctly.
- Communications: Changed the color codes used in the communications code (chats, tells, etc.) to use internal-only codes provided by KaVir's protocol snippet (below) so that player text can't interfere with color terminators.
- Coordinates: Many places that show coordinates will now show (unknown) if something is in a location that isn't associated with a map location.
- Emote: Fixed a double-message issue when you emote @self.
- Etalk: Prevent color leaks using internal color codes.
- Gear rating: The decimal rating of items is no longer referred to as the item's "gear level"; it is now consistently called "gear rating".
- Get/Stealing: Using 'get' to take items off of someone else's claimed land now checks your 'stealthable' toggle first.
- Group member death: Removed an extra CRLF after the group member death announcement.
- Group: No longer shows coordinates if you don't have Navigation, or if the group member is not in a room with a map location. Players who don't have Navigation will not have their coordinates show up to group members on the 'group' status display. The !LOCATION room template flag now prevents coordinates from appearing on a group member in the list.
- Import/export: Added the empire's mid-shipment items to the import/export calculations.
- Inventory: Using inventory in storage buildings will now show the correct totals including items mid-shipment.
- Islands: Increased the max line length on the islands display.
- Leaderboards: Timed out empires no longer show on the leaderboards. Also updated how timeouts are detected and how the leaderboards are built.
- Login sequence: Fixed an issue where the number of bad password attempts did not show if you got to the MOTD via an alternate route such as having to choose a new bonus trait. Simplified how the login sequence is displayed to prevent other similar issues in the future.
- Long strings: Raised the MAX_SOCK_BUF size to allow longer strings.
- Look direction: Improved the string formatter when you look in a direction so that mobs with a comma in their name don't result in funny text like "You see Zelkab and goblin bruiser."
- Map: Players will no longer appear on the 'political' and 'informative' ASCII maps, where they blocked the information on the tile they were covering.
- Mapsize: If you set your mapsize to "auto", the game will now attempt to detect the correct map size from your client. This is only relevant for the graphical map, and does not apply to the screenreader view (which isn't dependent upon screen size).e
- Movement: The 'fly' affect will no longer override a mob's normal movement type.
- Poisons: Poison type will now show on identify and stat.
- Political view: Fixed a bug where large-city-radius tiles not owned by the empire were highlighted when out of the normal city radius.
- Prompt: Moved afk and pvp to the %c conditions code, instead of defaulting them at the beginning (idle is still forced at the beginning). Added %d for blood-as-text. Updated the default prompts.
- Recolor: Fixed a color leak in recolored emote/socials and recolored empire chat. Fixed the color code display.
- Resurrect: Now shows the target's real (unmorphed) name so that it will always match the name of the corpse. Previously it might show the morphed name instead of the name on the corpse.
- Score: Added crafting level to score display.
- Ship status: Added a missing CRLF on the "nothing" on an empty "ship status".
- Ships: You will now always see the ship icon on the ASCII map if you are on board the ship, even if it otherwise wouldn't be shown on that tile.
- Slash channels: The player now gets an explicit join/leave message on slash channels, in case they can't see the channel join/leave announcements.
- Stealing: Changed the order on some error messages for taking items that aren't yours, to make more sense.
- Tavern: Giving an invalid tavern type will now give a better error message.
- Text editor: Now displays color codes in /r replacement strings, instead of evaluating them.
- Toggles: Immortal-only toggles now highlight in yellow. Also improved screen-reader display for toggles: they now each display on their own line in the format "name: on/off".
- Trade: The trading post displays now show an item's scaled level instead of its gear rating.
- Who: Now indicates class role via color or text. The who list also now sorts by role and level. AFK is now indicated in parentheses instead of brackets, to be consistent with other flags and so it can't be faked by a title.

Empires:
- Adjective: Fixed a bug where the adjective could have an ampersand at the end, causing it to eat color codes.
- Auto-abandon: Split this workforce chore into three different options, for the three chores that auto-abandon.
- Auto-balance: Removed this workforce chore; it is superceded by the shipping system (which requires ships and docks but not workforce).
- Banner: Stricter checking on color codes in banners to avoid certain rare issues.
- Banners: Added additional banner colors.
- Designate: Fixed a bug where designating a new room did not immediately add it to an empire's territory list.
- Einventory: Items currently being shipped are now included in the "total" section of einventory.
- Elog: Fixed the "elog shipping" option.
- Etalk: Fixed a bug with how the # argument targets ranks. You no longer need to type the color codes into the rank name.
- Homes privilege: Empires can now restrict lower ranks from setting homes.
- Last login time: Fixed a bug where an empire's last login time isn't reset each time members are updated. If an empire was past the timeout period (2 weeks) and 1 member logged in and then defected, the empire would still have that member's login time as the empire's last-login until a reboot, even though no current members had logged in.
- Milling: Added a workforce milling chore, which will turn any millable grains into flours at the Mill building.
- Name: Fixed a bug where the name could have an ampersand at the end, causing it to eat color codes.
- Newbie islands: Empires are now allowed to keep one claimed newbie-island tile per starting location (if there are 3 starting locations, an empire can have 3 claims on newbie islands). Empires less than 1 week old can still keep additional claims. Additionally, the newbie island claim check is now done every 12 real hours, not just on reboot.
- Political world map: Light and dark colors are now different on the political graphical map. Rewrote the code that generates the map output by banner color.
- Ranks: Added a format check to ranks to ensure they terminate underline characters.
- Redesignate: Added a 60 minute timer on redesignate.
- Secondary Territory: New building flag that marks a room as a certain type of territory. This is applied to ships so they don't count as out-of-city territory. Secondary territory also auto-abandons if the empire times out.
- Storage privilege: Empires can now restrict lower ranks from retrieving or summoning materials from the einventory.
- Storage: The order of empire storage is now preserved through reboots so that the order of some displays doesn't change.
- Territory overages: Fixed a small bug in the code that removes outside-of-city territory when an empire is over its maximum. It was not correctly finding the most distant tile to abandon first.
- Timeout: Added a minimum playtime to count as an empire member.
- Warehouse privilege: Empires can now restrict lower ranks from retrieving unique items from the warehouse.
- Workforce: Added a new workforce chore: dismantle-mines. Also re-ordered some code in the regular dismantle chore processor so that it doesn't show as "Someone finishes dismantling" when the mob despawns before the message is sent. Fixed a memory leak in chores. Fixed a bug in how workforce counts resources in the shipping queue, which was blocking it from using the 25-item limit in some cases. Workforce will no longer farm non-storable crops. Replaced the system which the Workforce system uses to check if an empire has a resource overage. The new system reduces the number of times an empire's resources must be counted, and also reduces over-spawning workers when the empire is close to its cap.

Help files:
- Binding: Updated claimed land note with correct info.
- Buff: New help file.
- Debuff: New help file.
- Douse: Added information on the fire brigade.
- File: Fixed outdated information on log parsing.
- Find Shelter: Added a list of buildable shelters.
- Inspire: Added durations.
- Light: Added more information on fire-building.
- Master Blacksmith: Clarified how this ability works.
- Master Tailor: Clarified how this ability works and removed some outdated information.
- Mgoto: Fixed all help files that claim you can use %goto% as a script command; this was never true.
- Ride: Added more information on the benefits of mounts, and removed some outdated information.
- Scalable Crafts: Updated information and see also.
- See Also: Updated many see-also sections of help files.
- Superior: Added more information on how the superior flag works.
- Tabs: Removed some stray tab characters from help files, which interpret them as the start of color codes.
- Various: Typo fixes.
- Various: Updates and contributions from Yvain.
- Wait: Removed this keyword from the command queue help, as it blocked an important OLC help.

Immortals:
- Addnotes: New command adds a line to player notes without going into an editor.
- Alternate: Removed the alternate cooldown for immortals.
- Error logs: Fixed a typo in the path shown in "bad index entry" error messages.
- File: This command now shows raw color codes instead of parsing them.
- Incognito: Added a toggle that removes an immortal from the 'who' list without making them invisible to tells, chats, and in the room.
- Movement: Fixed a bug where immortals were checked for enough movement points to make a move, but not charged the cost of it. Immortals no longer require movement points at all.
- Oset: New grantable immortal command can modify flags, strings, and timers of live items.
- Prompt: Moved invis and wizlock to the new %C prompt code, which also shows incognito and wizhide.
- Rescale: Improved how traits are preserved when an immortal rescales an item, and merged this functionality with the code that updates items on login.
- Restore: Now removes DoT effects.
- Slay: Now ensures a mob is scaled before being slain. Also removes Phoenix Rite from the target first.
- Stat object: Added book vnum info to the "stat" info for book objects.
- Stealing: Immortals stealing from other empires will now trigger a 'steal' abuse log.
- Visible: This command now also removes incognito and wizhide.
- Vnum: Added books to the vnum command.
- Vstat: Added books to the vstat command.
- Wizhide: Added a toggle that allows an immortal to not appear on 'look' or for in-room functions, but the immortal is not otherwise invisible.
- Wizlock: Removed an extra CRLF that was appended to the wizlock message when set by an immortal, by adding one when it is displayed to new connections instead.

Instances:
- Saving: Instance data now only saves when the world files are saved, as it's meaningless without the associated world data.
- Unlinking bug: Fixed an issue where the home room of instances which link to interior rooms (e.g. Primeval) would lose its HAS_INSTANCE room affect flag on reboot. This flag is set on the home room to prevent claiming (etc).

Islands:
- Names: Island names may no longer contain quotation marks.

Major bugs:
- Ally detection: Fixed a bug where abilities like Outrage would hit your familiar if you're not in combat already.
- Cleanse: Fixed an off-by-one error that was causing cleanse to remove the haste affect, which is usually considered beneficial. It would also not remove certain negative affects as a result.
- Crops: Planting crops will now preserve the original tile sector in the ROOM_ORIGINAL_SECT field, and this is preserved through crop growth. When a crop is harvested, chopped, or devastated, it will return to its original sector. Previously, it always reverted to the default sector for its climate, which prevented multiple tile types from being plantable in the same climate.
- Daily bonus experience: When the mud is down more than 24 hours, it will no longer reset the daily experience cycle every 75 seconds for a number of iterations equal to the number of days it was down. Instead, it will only update once.
- DoT Effects: Fixed an issue where saving the character (even manually) was removing all DoT effects.
- Efind: Fixed an overflow bug that crashed the game, with proper length checking.
- Help files: Fixed a bug where no help file was found if the "best match" help file is above the user's level. This was causing some immortal help files to mask certain keywords on mortal help files.
- Home set: Fixed a bug where removing the NPCs from a home when you set it as your own was causing odd memory corruption as it tried to set a value on a non-existent territory-npc to null. This was resulting in the elog for that home-set to be truncated, and may have reached additional memory as well.
- Import/export: Fixed a bug where items in the shipping queue were not being counted when determining how much to import.
- Iron mines: Moved the code that calculates the 1/101 chance of gold in iron mines. Its old location was interfering with workforce limits in a way that caused iron miners to spawn and despawn erratically without ever mining iron (in empires with full iron but not full gold).
- Login location: Fixed a bug where logging out on a ship (or otherwise losing your stored location) would result in respawning at a tomb on the wrong island, especially on a ship that has moved.
- MXP: Moved up the MXP version request in order to fix an issue where connections sometimes didn't have the correct color code before their first "look".
- Manufacture: Fixed an error in the order of error checks which led to a crash if the ship was missing (hotfixed September 5).
- Newbie empire timeout: Fixed a bug where creating an empire then quitting and logging back in while under 1 hour of playtime would show your empire as having zero members and unable to claim land.
- OLC: Fixed a bug in the icon editor that caused a full game crash when removing all icons.
- Resistance: Fixed an issue where the Resist Physical and Resist Magical traits could reduce 100% of damage, not the intended 25%.
- Script damage: Damage from mob scripts including %damage% and %aoe% had a major bug where the multiplier was applied twice. This meant healing scripts did not work (modifier was negative) and damage scaled too low or high (25% was effectively 6%).
- Shipping: Fixed a bug where incomplete ships could be pulled for shipping (hotfixed September 5).
- Shipping: One ship can no longer have multiple destination islands.
- Ships: Fixed a bug where ships were never abandoned even if an empire was very stale and long gone. They now abandon after outside territory but before in-city territory, when the empire has timed out. Also fixed an issue where ships sometimes counted as out-of-city territory.
- Text editor: Fixed a crash bug triggered by repeatedly trying to add text when a string buffer is full.
- Unique storage: Fixed a bug where warehouse/vault unique storage would be lost by an empire which merged into another empire. Also fixed a small memory leak where deleting an empire did not free its unique storage.
- char_to_store: Fixed an issue in the error reporting on too-many-affects-to-save.

Major changes:
- Actions: Instead of 5-second "timed action" intervals where some abilities give you more chops/builds per tick, actions have been reworked to have 5-second timers with multiple things that can shorten the timers.
- Affects: Now tracking the caster id of all affects and DoTs.
- DoTs: DoTs will now stack per caster, rather than all players contributing to the same stack.
- Fast-Chores, Finder, Haste, Shovel: Instead of chopping/building an extra item per tick, these will now shorten the time interval between chops/builds.
- Haste: Now also affects dig, harvest, music (play), picking, planting, and quarrying. (This includes haste effects from any source.)
- KaVir's Protocol Snippet: I have ported KaVir's protocol snippet to EmpireMUD. This supports several protocols, such as MXP and MSDP (see HELP MSDP in-game). It also supports some additional features which we are not enabling by default, such as extended color codes. Fixed some small issues in the color parsing portion.
- Sailing: This is now a timed action instead of a spam-directions command.

Minor bugs:
- Abandon: Abandoning a building now clears its private home owner, if it has one, and removes the chest.
- Arson: Players with no empire can now burn down buildings that are not claimed.
- MXP: Added MXP tags to reconnect and to two alternate login paths, to ensure everyone gets one.
- Users: Prevent two users from having the same descriptor number on the 'users' list when the number rolls over.

Map:
- Irrigation: Irrigating desert using rivers will now create a temporary plains type which will automatically revert to desert over time if the river is removed. It has its own forest and jungle types, which also automatically revert. On existing EmpireMUDs, this will only apply to tiles that irrigate after this patch goes live. Existing tiles have the old plains type.
- Sector evolutions: Map tiles that serve as the entrance for other tiles will no longer evolve — they are considered "managed" by the tile they are the entrance for.

Mobiles:
- Aggro: Mobs with the aggro flag will not longer attack human NPCs inside adventures (they will continue to attack them on the map).
- Familiars: Added the giant tortoise, dire wolf, moon rabbit, spirit wolf, manticore, phoenix, scorpion shadow, owl shadow, basilisk, salamander, skeletal hulk, and banshee familiars (with triggers).
- NPC spawns: Fixed a bug where interior rooms of some buildings were never hitting the spawn-npcs code because the buildings themselves had no spawn lists. This was preventing many homes from spawning citizens in their extra bedrooms, although the citizens did technically live there and could be called for workforce chores. They just never spawned at home.
- No-Attack: Added a new mob flag which indicates the mob can join combat and run fight triggers, but will never deal a normal hit.
- Ordered: Added a new aff flag, ORDERED, that prevents some scripting commands that were previously prevented by CHARM. This allows familiars and other pets to have certain triggers fire even though they are charmed, without allowing them to be ordered to do it.
- Overburdened: Mobs no longer become overburdened (but players still can't overfill mob inventories with 'give').
- Scaling: When a mob re-scales, it will now preserve any lost health/mana/moves, preventing mobs from healing spontaneously mid-combat if they somehow re-scale.
- Stun: Fixed a bug where mobs heal but don't un-stun.

Objects:
- Attributes: Changed how primary attributes are checked when equipping an item so that something with both -1 Strength and +2 Strength can still be equipped with a net gain of +1 Strength, instead of being told you're too weak due to the -1 Strength.
- Corpses: Now marked as 'junk' to prevent storage and trading of corpses.
- Crafter items: Added the first tier of crafter items (clockwork goggles, guildmaster tunic, utility belt, steel multitool), bringing craft level to 200. Also added a 2nd tier of crafter items pushing crafter level to 300.
- Crafting: Added a new item trait, +CRAFTING, which affects character crafting level. Finishing or canceling a craft will now always give the resulting item(s) to the character if they are take-able, rather than putting them in the room if the character is overburdened.
- Gear level requirements: A player's highest-ever level is now stored, allowing them to use items as if they still had that level. This fixes the "gear cascade" where removing one item leads to more and more items fall off every 15 minutes until you're too low level to use any of them.
- Get: Items that can't be picked up will no longer block "get all" from continuing past them.
- Junk: You can no longer store items flagged "junk" in warehouses.
- Level requirement: Items now require that you be no more than 25 levels below their level to use them (50 for BoP items). This applies to items over level 100, while retaining the skill level check against the 50/75/100 ranges for low-level items. This uses highest-recent-level, so removing your gear and then re-equipping it within 15 minutes should not prevent the re-equip.
- Low attributes: If your attributes drop too low to use some of your gear, but you are morphed, it will no longer fall off right away. Morphs still need the strength to use additional items, but won't automatically stop using existing ones.
- Nexus crystals: This item now stores in the Tower of Sorcery instead of the Portal.
- Rescaling/refreshing: Items no longer lose custom strings when rescaled or refreshed by the object loader.
- Saddles: The find-best-saddle algorithm now prefers saddles bound to the player over ones that are similar in level but not bound.
- Scaled level: All items now receive a scaled level based on what mob dropped them or which crafter made them. This includes items whose stats are not scaled (items which lack the SCALABLE flag).
- Sealskin leggings: Corrected a typo.
- Shipping: The shipping system should now better-detect if a ship is already full, to prevent it from blocking other ships.
- Ships: Now have capacities for use with the storage system. Items on ships will not despawn while mid-shipment.
- Shovel: Now works from the sheath slot, if the shovel can be sheathed.
- Steel multitool: Corrected the craft type in its description.
- Stock items: Added a set of "miscellaneous reward" items in the 9900 block.
- Tier 2 crafting patterns: These patterns are now dropped by any group (or boss) mob in the 175-250 level range, using a global loot table.
- Trading Post: You can no longer post items for sale if they have the 'junk' flag or if they have a decay timer (e.g. lights).
- Trinkets: Updated the trinket scripts with handling for 'adventure summon'.

OLC:
- !LOCATION: New room template flag for adventures that are not associated to their map tile. This flag hides coordinates and changes how 'nearby' and 'where' perform.
- Adventures: These now have scripts, but they only support the Adventure Cleanup room trigger type.
- Apply: Added the ".apply change" option to objects.
- Auditors: Added auditors for adventures, buildings, and room templates. Also added sub-auditors for spawns, interactions, and extra descriptions. Improved the existing craft, mobile, and object auditors.
- Build crafts: Added a "not player made" build-on flag that blocks building on player-made rivers, etc.
- Buildings: Added a NEED-BOAT flag for buildings.
- Custom messages: Added the ".custom change" option to objects.
- Evolutions: Added NOT-ADJACENT and NOT-NEAR-SECTOR evolution types. Added the ".evolution change" option to sectors.
- Extra descriptions: Updated extra descs to use ".extra change" to be consistent with all other options.
- Global tables: Added a full OLC suite for new global interaction tables.
- Icons: Added the ".icons change" option. Fixed a bug in how icon lengths are counted based on counting color codes. This also affected how icons are displayed when they contain &&&&.
- Interactions: Fixed a small bug where the interaction percent would accept "0.1" but not ".1".
- Lists: Added the -d detail option to the .list command.
- Map editor: Added the '.map build' command for adding buildings which don't have craft recipes.
- Map output colors: Added additional color options for sector/crop output color.
- Object auditor: Now checks for multiple bind flags as well as any loot quality flags.
- Room template list: Added some flags to the -d version of the list.
- Ruins: Added '.map ruin' to instantly ruin a building.
- Sector editor: Fixed bug where lower-level builders could not edit sectors even when flagged with permission.
- Setflags: No longer logs or saves the target if no flags are changed.
- Spawns: Added the ".spawns change" option.
- Special icons: Added the @. special icon code to represent the roadside icon for the base sector of the current tile.
- Storage: Added the ".storage change" option to objects.

PHP utilities:
- map.php: Added support for additional colors.

Players:
- Gear level: Changed the calculation for player gear level. Instead of using the sum of the gear ratings of items, it now computes the average scaled level of equipped items (some slots count as more, others as less), with a bonus for superior/hard/group items. The gear level is 50 higher than this average, minus 100 so that total level comes out to 50 higher than the average equipped item.
- Levels: Players now store highest-known-level and last-known-level instead of highest-recent-level and recent-level-time. The who and whois commands now always show current level instead of highest-recent-level. Highest-known-level is only used to determine whether gear can be used or not. Existing EmpireMUDs will not have last-known-level data for existing players until they log in again, so zeroes on roster and show-account are normal until then.
- Names: Added a config option that restricts the number of capital letters that can be in a name. This defaults to 2.
- Offers: Added a new system where players can have generic short-lived offers processed by the accept and reject commands. Offers only exist while the player is in-game and expire on logout.
- Timed actions: Fixed a bug where actions that should allow you to move without canceling, weren't working since the b2.9 rewrite of the action handler.

Scripting:
- %actor.is_name(str)%: New character name matching function.
- %dot%: Fixed a bug in the object trigger version of %dot% where the argument order was wrong, leading to unpredictable results. Also added support for a "max stacks" parameter.
- %echoneither%: Added a new script command that sends a message to all but two people.
- %instance.mob()%: Added a new way to look up an instance's copy of a mob.
- %item.is_name(str)%: Changed how item names are matched to match other code functions.
- %regionecho%: Now auto-capitalizes the line like other script echo commands.
- %room.building% – New getter for building name of a map or interior room.
- %room.crop% – New getter for crop name of a map room.
- %room.direction(target)% – New getter for the direction from one location to another.
- %room.distance(target)% – New getter for map distance between two locations.
- %terracrop% – New script command for terraforming to a crop type.
- %terraform%: Added a new script command that changes map tiles.
- // – Added remainder operator (can't use % because it's used by variables)
- Adventure Cleanup: A new room trigger type that is called on a room after an adventure is removed from it.
- Command triggers: Improved how command triggers process to better hit abbreviations without blocking the wrong command.
- Crafting level: Added %actor.crafting_level% variable.
- Damage: Fixed a bug where scripts could damage the dead, triggering repeat logs.
- Instance variables: Added %instance.start% and %instance.location% variables.
- Mob script commands: These commands are now prevented by the ORDERED effect instead of CHARM.
- Room owner: Added %room.empire_adjective%, %room.empire_id%, and %room.empire_name% getters.
- Trigger saving: Triggers now properly save to their items, mobs, rooms, etc. — instead of needing to be re-attached after every reboot.
- Triggers: Added a Fight-Charmed mob trigger type that will fire in combat even if the mob is charmed.
- cancel_adventure_summon: New character command to prevent a player from being teleported back to their previous location, e.g. after trinketing.
- ~=: Fixed a bug in the ~= operator.

Sectors:
- Desert: Updated the desert-to-grove evolutions to create less grove-dense deserts.

- Fastcasting: A new ability on all healer classes which lowers command lag on
non-combat spells (including heals) by 0.1 second per 3 Wits. It also removes

- Medium Armor: Lowered to level 50. Medium armor is now a hybrid dps/tank set
that's also good for PVP. No longer has pre-requisites.

maximum health to 100 but prevented overhealing.

to Greatness.
- Quick Block: Now gives +10 or +10% of level, whichever is better (at class

belonging to another empire. Now checks the stealthable flag and empire stealth
permission. Also fixed a bug where you could shadowstep out of no-teleport
rooms.
- Siege Ritual: Now triggers hostile status. Now able to target open buildings
as well as closed ones.

additional piece of -Strength gear. Increased the mana penalty in this form.

Adventures:
- 101 Magiterranean: The Hidden Garden: A new craft/crop adventure with no
combat and 4 unique items.
- 120 Red Dragon: Fixed a typo in the charm's look description.
- 122 Three Banditos: Fixed two kill scripts.
- 125 The Goblin Challenge: Fixed typo in keywords on Zelkab's gauntlets.
Changed the timepiece and necklace generic drops from BoP to BoE. All BoE items
in this adventure also gained the GENERIC loot flag. Removed the built-in
(superior) flags on loot items. This is replaced by the drop-scaling change
below. Fixed the long description on the goblin champion. Added an
%adventurecomplete% command to the warg spawn death trigger, to fix an issue
where spawning the warg prevents completion.
- 140 The Sewers: Ratskins: Fixed a typo in the waste that flows slowly past.
- 160 The Tower Skycleave: Fixed a typo in Celiya's trigger text. Fixed a
script typo that lead to error logs. Updated another script, which used the
now-outdated SOAK affect type. Corrected the word 'otherworldy' in the long
description. Corrected a typo in the Goblin Cages (2) room description. Fixed
the buy message at the shop. Added a missing keyword to the experimental
handrwaps. Lowered the payout on the pixy races to prevent an infinite money
exploit. Fixed two kill scripts. Fixed the name of the iris reagent in the
shop.
- 161 Portal to the Primeval: A new adventure for levels 75-100 with hunting,
tracking, skinning, and crafting. This adds several new craftable items in the
100-125 level range.
- 170 Hamlet of the Undead: New 175-225 adventure.
- 200 Burrow Canyons: Applied missing INFRA flags to mobs. Fixed the keywords
on the pears, which had "tree" but not "juicy".
- 201 Mill Manor: Added missing keywords to the caretaker. Updated the text in
the mage's journal (book id 24) to correct some typoes and to add a hint for
the reminder text. Also fixed keywords on the dorsal spine mace. Added missing
bind flags to items. Also fixed the wear locations and added missing -1 Wits on
the Titanaconda scale trousers. Also fixed an issue in its linking rule that
resulted in it blocking off its own exit.
- 281 Mountain Valley: Molten Fiend - A new, short group adventure for the
200-250 level range.
- All stock adventures: Updated most armor and any items that used to give
+soak with new stats. Updated the loot drop rates and loot exclusion sets on
many NPCs with the new interaction exclusion system, generally raising overall
loot drop chance slightly.
- Confusing random exits: Added an adventure option that prevents the instancer
from trying to logically match random exits.
- Instancing: The instance linker will now check if it needs a certain
direction inside, before picking that direction for the building to face. This
keeps instances from blocking their own exits. Fixed an off-by-one error in the
instancing code where the first valid location for an adventure could not be
picked, and adventures with only one valid link point could not spawn.
- Must-Fight Triggers: All stock adventures with must-fight triggers on mobs
have been updated to ignore invisibility and blindness using Leave-All
triggers.
- Not-near-self: New adventure linking option prevents adventures from spawning
too close to other copies of the same adventure. Applied this option to all
included adventures except 100 The Grove.

instance limits.

Buildings:
- Apiary: No longer lists storage commands in its commands line.
- Critters: Reduced the spawn locations for small critter mobs.

them.
- !delete: New building flag prevents auto-deletion during homeroom check on
startup.
- Dock: Added 'unload' to list of commands.
- Experience: The build action now grants experience per resource added plus a
little bit at the end, rather than only a lump sum at the end.
- High Temple: Updated the description, which came from a time when all temples
faced North, and which really misused the word 'magnanimous'. Added HALL and
TUNNEL designate flags, as it had none.
- Smokehouse: Can no longer be burnt down when you light a fire inside to make
smoked foods. Also now has a cooking fire of its own.
- Quarries: Workforce was incorrectly using the wrong, higher depletion limit
on quarries.
- Stable: No more than two of each type of NPC will now stay in a stable.
- Training Yard: Changed the build recipe from 'training yard' to
'trainingyard' to be consistent with all other buildings.

Code cleanup:
- Affects: Added data for storage of a caster id for affects, for future development.
- Command lag: Replaced inline use of WAIT_STATE() in most places to the new
command_lag() function, which takes a "lag type" to allow abilities to modify
the lag time on some types of commands. Also removed all remaining uses of the
deprecated WAIT_STATE() macro in favor of GET_WAIT_STATE().
- Converter: Added a playerfile converter program specifically for b1.x -> b2.0 updates.
- is_fighting: Provided a new function that determines if a character is being
attacked, in addition to whether or not he is attacking.
- Playerfile spares: Moved spares used in b1.* to permanent locations.
- Shear: Rewrote shear to use an INTERACTION_FUNC.
- skills.c: Moved two functions that were in the wrong section of the file, and
ordered the switch statement for abilities. These appeared to have been missed
in the alpha cleanup.
- Skin: Rewrote skin to use an INTERACTION_FUNC.
- util: Fixed the order of libs in the util Makefile.in because some systems
are pickier about argument order to the compiler.

Combat:
- Autokill: When fighting a hard/group/boss mob, it's no longer possible to
incapacitate them by shutting off autokill.
- Blind: Now applies a flat -50 to Block, Dodge and To-Hit if you can't see
your target.
- Block: Removed diminishing returns and reworked block to have a predictable
cap based on the mob's level. Block also has an absolute maximum chance of 50%.
Removed the 5% base block chance (block now relies more on gear).
- Dexterity: Reduced the hit/dodge modifier for Dexterity from 10 to 5; the
to-hit and dodge traits now make up a larger portion of hit chance.
- Dodge: Reworked the entire dodge formula to create a real Dodge cap. Updated
the help file to explain better.
- Hit chance: There is now an absolute minimum to-hit chance of 5% so long as
the character is at least equal to the victim in level.
- Hostile flag: Attacking a person who is PVP-flagged or marked as hostile will
no longer mark you as hostile as well.
- No-attack: If a person gains an !ATTACK flag mid-combat, it should now remove
them from combat.
- PVP flag: Attacking a familiar will no longer result in empire hostility when
the master is PVP-flagged. Guards will no longer auto-assist players who are
using the PVP toggle for consensual player-vs-player combat.
- Resist-Magical, Resist-Physical: Added physical resistance, which reduces
physical and fire damage by up to 25% based on the amount of this trait, with
the cap based on the level of the attacker. Magical resistance works the same
but for magical damage.
- Siege Attacks: You can no longer besiege a starting location (e.g. with a
catapult).
- Soak: Removed the soak trait.
- To-Hit: Reworked the entire to-hit formula to create a real Hit cap. Updated
the help file to explain better. There is now a minimum 5% chance to-hit for
players and 25% chance to-hit for mobs, so long as they are within 50 levels of
the victim.

- Alternate: Now echoes a "Name has left the game" to the room when it removes
the old alt.
- Bathe: No longer allows NPCs to attempt to bathe.

- Catapult: Now triggers hostile status.
- /check: You can now see which slash-channels another player is on with you.
- Chop and mine: Now both use weapon dps, not raw damage, as modifiers on chore
speed. This slows both chores down slightly.
- Chop: Increased the chop speed contribution from weapon damage. Chop now has
members-only permissions, rather than guest permissions. This means you can't
chop on an allied or public tile.
- Circle: Now has normal movement lag, and correctly checks if the player is
overburdened.
- City: Clarified the invalid-terrain error for founding a city.
- City found: Added a list of sector flags which block city found, fixing a bug
in founding a city on a crop.
- Command lag: Changed the base command lag from 1.1 seconds to 1.25 seconds,
to allow for abilities that lower it (e.g. Fastcasting).
- Confirm: Now correctly shows "shutdown" or "reboot" based on which type is
scheduled.
- Demote: No longer allows you to demote someone who is above your rank.
- Designate: Removed armor storage, which was outdated.

anywhere in the world.
- Drop: Fixed a double-error message on "drop all.item" when you have no
matches.
- Eedit rank: Now accepts - and ' as valid rank characters.
- Einv: Rewrote the einv command completely because the previous version did
not correctly handle cases where an empire had storage on more than two
islands.
- Enter: Entering portals now has normal movement lag. You can no longer enter
a portal if you don't have permission to use the room it's in.
- Exchange: No longer shows the same coin amount twice, instead of the correct
amounts.

map.
- /f: Updated the string formatter to ignore color codes when determining line
length.

useless to mortals anyway.
- Grants: Fixed the order of grants in constants.c because some grants were
misaligned.
- Herd: No longer works on mobs marked aggressive, group, or hard.
- Identify: Fixed an incorrect stat on food, where hours of fullness was
divided by 15.
- Import analyze: Now shows all empires, not just trading partners.
- /join: You can no longer join a slash-channel with no name.
- Junk: Fixed a bug where junk was checking some 'drop' limitations like
bound-items-in-claimed-rooms and room capacities.
- Keep, unkeep: Added a way to prevent items from being included in "all" and
"all.name" commands like drop, put, give, sacrifice, junk, and store.
- /m: New version of /l in the string editor gives the current buffer with
parsed color codes (default is to show the raw codes).
- Mine: Increased the mine speed contribution from weapon damage.
- Mint: The mint command will correctly cancel the minting action if you're
already doing it, rather than just saying it cancels it.
- Pledge: Fixed the argument parser, which dropped fill words like 'the' and
incorrectly only took 1-word arguments.
- Portal: Portals over 50 map tiles in distance now cost 1 nexus crystal per 75
tiles, rounded up. No longer shows incomplete portal buildings on the list.

- Sail: Added the missing "from" in the ship-sails message.
- Sayhistory: Fixed an issue where socials were adding extra linebreaks.

- Toggles: No longer allow NPCs to use toggles.
- Toggle stealthable: This new preference blocks you from accidentally
stealing.
- Tomb: Can now be used to unset your tomb while dead.
- Trade: The trading post no longer allows you to post stolen items.
- Trade list: Rearranged where coins are displayed so it's "actual (exchange)
empire" rather than "actual empire (exchange)" and added an indicator if you
cannot use the item.
- Warehouse: You can no longer warehouse store stolen items.
- Wear all: Fixed a bug where gear slots that have more than one slot, like
neck, weren't cascading when a player typed 'wear all'.
- Weave: Will now show "nothing" when you can't weave anything.
- Who: Allow the who command to target by empire name, show invis level even on
the shortlist, and updated its help file and syntax.
- Workforce: Added the "workforce where" option to see how many chore NPCs are
working.

Core changes:
- !AGGRO Islands: New island flag allows full disabling of guard towers and
aggro mobs.
- Interactions: Replaced the 'exclusive' interaction bit with an interaction
exclusion set identifier (char). Exclusion sets now use a cumulative roll,
rather than rolling for each interaction in the set. Only one interaction from
each exclusion set can fire. The file format does not change; interactions
previously marked exclusive are now part of exclusion set 'X'. Updated
interactions that required it for this system. The run_interactions() and
run_room_interactions() functions were changed to support this. Rooms that run
any successful interaction from one source (e.g. sector, crop) will no longer
run any other sets.
- Islands: EmpireMUD now stores meta-data about islands including names, and
computes their locations.
- Newbie Islands: Empires over 1 week old(configurable) cannot maintain claims
on newbie islands through reboots. Auto-abandons from this will show up on the
elog.
- Stuns: When a character enters combat, all stun effects will break
immediately. This does not apply if the character was already in combat when he
became stunned.

Crops:
- Plantains: Added plantains as a base crop for jungles, as the code supports
jungle crops but had none live. These won't spawn in the wild using the current
version of the map generator, but the code requires at least one valid crop for
each location.

Displays:
- Abilities: Moved up the "you must purchase the ability" message ahead of
other errors. Fixed the plural in the "not enough energy" message for
abilities, which showed on "forage" as "You need 1 move points..."
- Auto-assist: Corrected the word "aid", which was written "aide".
- Biting: The message shown to the room no longer says "she has his fangs...".
- Consider: Added more clear level and difficulty info, and added notes if
hit/dodge are too low. Consider now also scales the mob first to get a better
measure of its power.
- Daily skill points: This feature has been renamed "daily bonus experience
points" to help make it less confusing for new players.
- Death: Fixed the death message when a person dies on his own rather than from
a killer. Tweaked the death message slightly to make it more apparent what has
happened.
- Diplomacy: Fixed a typo in a diplomacy empire log.
- Disarm: Corrected capitalization in an error message.
- Dispel: Fixed target of the no-affliction error message's gender.
- Distrust: Automatic distrust now logs the name of the player who triggered
it, to that player's empire only (the enemy doesn't see which player it was).
- Ellipses: Found all remaining places where ".." is used either as an ellipsis
or a typo, and fixed them.
- Empire: Privileges are now shown on the top empire rank, just like all the
others, on your own empire's detail.
- Empire population: Fixed a bug where killing an empire NPC would not update
the population count right away.
- Familiar: Added missing linebreak to the list, and added a note in the
unlikely event the person has no available familiars.
- Heal: Removed double-error messages in heal friend and heal party, when you
haven't purchased the correct ability.
- Incapacitation: Fixed a typo in the incapacitation message.
- Info: Fixed note on regen, which said it was per-hour. Also fixed the /newbie
channel info.
- Logins: No longer show slash-channel joins on logins.
- Look at character: Long description now automatically has a color terminator.
- Map PCs: Fixed a display error when two players from different empires are in
a room together on the visible map; the wrong character in the <oo> was being
colored for the second player.
- Newbies: Added a mortlog indicating a player is new to the game.
- No-Dismantle: Now appears on the 'look' display even when the location is not
claimed.
- Oasis: No longer shows 'fillin' on its command list.
- Order: Fixed a misspelling of schizophrenia.
- Pickpocket: Removed extra line break in two pickpocket messages.
- Pour: Fixed a typo when the container is empty. Also fixed a case where the
typed-in argument is used instead of the short description.
- Prompt: Added the %r prompt code for immortals to see the template/sector
vnum they are in. Added a trailing space to the default prompts. Removed a
trailing space that was added to some, but not all generated prompts.
- Public logins: Added a config option that changes the mortlogs on
login/out/alternate into empire logs, allowing more privacy for logins and
logouts. The "switch" message for alternate is only shown if both alts are in
the same empire.
- Rejuvenate: Fixed a typo in the to-character message.
- Roster: Fixed a bug where the (online) tag was applied if the member's name
is an abbreviation of someone who is online. Also loading live data for level
and class where possible, rather than using outdated saved data.
- Score: To-hit and dodge now include all available modifiers instead of only
showing value from gear/affects. Now shows skill level in parentheses after the
total level.
- Score: Fixed the length of the bottom divider.
- Show player: Now shows the host a user created from.
- Show stats: Added account stats (total, active, this week) to show stats.
- Socials: Worked on the custom color coding issue and cleaned up some color
code sends, but there is still a bug where an extra line is added to
sayhistory.
- Stat character: Fixed a display bug where the wrong person's dexterity was
subtracted from dodge rating. Now shows the host a user created from.
- Stolen items: The tag (STOLEN) now appears next to stolen items in lists,
until their stolen timer expires.
- Summon Humans: Changed the order of error messages to make more sense.
- Survey: Now indicates which island you are one.
- Stroke: Fixed a $s that should have been $S in this social.
- Weather: Typo fix.
- Weave: Added missing linebreak when you don't know how to weave anything.
- Who: When using the 'who' command with no visible players, an uninitialized
string was displaying. Now shows max players today and max players this uptime.
- Whole source update: Thing has been gracious enough to go through all of the
help files, readmes, combat messages, and code. He has fixed a large number of
typoes, some going back as far as the CircleMUD base.

Empires:
- Changeleader: New eedit option allows the current leader (or an immortal,
administratively) to change the empire leader. The old leader keeps his/her
rank but the new leader is always promoted to top rank.
- Rogue: Players who perform hostile/stealth actions while not a member of any
empire will now gain the 'rogue' flag. This flag is visible on the who list and
lasts longer than 'hostile'. It is otherwise identical in function.
- Ruined cities: Added an elog when a city is abandoned as ruins, due to having
no non-ruined buildings inside of it.
- Traits: Updated how empire trait changes log to the empire log.
- War: It now costs coins to go to war with another empire, with the cost based
on the difference in composite empire score, rising parabolically until it hits
a score difference of 50. Minimum and maximum costs are set in configs
war_cost_min and war_cost_max. Players can view the cost to go to war on the
empire detail page.
- Workforce: Added a maximum resource cap for workforce that is not
island-dependent, but instead related to the number of players in the empire.

Game Balance:
- Blind/Darkness: Being unable to see your opponent no longer negates dodge and
block. Instead, you now get a 33% block, dodge, and to-hit penalty when you
cannot see your opponent.

spells.
- Inspire: Clarified move cost.

restricted to approved players.

HELP SKILL LEVELS.

current move pool twice.
- Arctic crafts: Added missing BOE flags on craftable arctic items.
- Armbands of Power: Fixed typo in look description.
- Armor: Updated virtually all armor items in the game with corrected stats
based on the current armor paradigm. Lowered item scaling bonuses from armor
types.
- Autostore: Unique items left on the ground will now autostore to warehouse
storage, if possible, rather than staying as clutter. Added a new !AUTOSTORE
item flag that causes some items to be ignored by autostore. Applied this to
furniture.
- Auto-updates: Added a configurable option that will cause items in player
inventory, empire inventory, room packs, and on the trading post to auto-update
when loaded if the version is changed. Existing .obj files are
backwards-compatible.
- Barley: Can now be created by the gods.
- Block: Altered the amount of BLOCK that appears on scaled items. This will
allow for block on more items overall, instead of stacking high block values at
low gear levels.
- Blood: Drinking blood no longer makes you less hungry.

will now be destroyed after one week (real time). They will no longer preserve
on the ground forever.

- can_wear_item: Fixed an off-by-one error where it was saying "You must be
skill level 50 to use this" when <= 50.
- Carts: Fixed a bug where a cart (or other pullable) could be teleported to
the animal that was pulling it if they got separated.
- City mob drops: Applied correct max levels on some items dropped by city
mobs, so that players don't receive over-scaled versions of common items.
- Cotton: Replaced the "coming soon" description.
- Custom eat messages: Added support for custom strings on food items.
- Decay: When an item decays while it contains coins and is in a player's
inventory (or equipment), the coins will now process properly instead of going
to the inventory as an item.
- Dodge: Raised dodge scaling level on items slightly.
- Dragon scale: Fixed a typo in the short description of the dragon scale item
from the Red Dragon adventure.
- Foods: Added about a dozen new food items and recipes from the builder port.

- Iron Blades: Added iron versions of the shovel and hammer.
- Flint stone: Updated the description to have the correct command for making
the flint set.
- Gear score: Adjusted the raw value of gear score on items across the board.
This is a change to the reported gear level, not to scaled attribute values.

recipe, which required the wrong object.
- Health: Raised max-health scaling on items slightly.
- Intelligence potion: Fixed a typo in the long description.
- Letheian icon: A new Master Pottery item that grants a skill reset.
- Lightning staff: Fixed the "lighting" typo in three kill and miss messages.
- Magic Frost damage: Fixed a typo where the 'magic frost' damage type's normal
speed was 3.3, not 4.3 (its fast is 4.1 and slow is 4.5).
- Nexus crystal: New item crafted from any of the four colored magical gems,
using Portal Magic. This item is stored at portal buildings and is used to open
portals.
- Overburdened: Instead of automatically dropping items when overburdened,
characters are now prevented from moving (simple move, enter, board,
disembark). Removing equipment no longer drops it to the room if your inventory
is full.
- Pan: Added the TOOL-PAN obj flag and converted the panning system to use this
flag instead of a vnum. Updated the stock pan.
- Ram's shield: Corrected the look description, which appeared to have been
copied from the kite shield.
- Rocks: Corrected the list of functions in the look description.
- Saddles: This gear slot no longer affects player's gear level.
- Scaling: Added new HARD-DROP and GROUP-DROP flags which boost item scaling by
1.2x and 1.4x, respectively (combined, 1.68x). These flags are set
automatically when an item is dropped as loot by a hard/group mob. Also added
GENERIC-DROP flag to block those other two flags on generic loot.
- Sealskin: Removed the keyword 'large' because this item was conflicting with
the regular large skin on both keywords.
- Sealskin leggings: Updated the craft name to correctly match the item.
- Sharp tools and hammers: Commands that require a sharp tool or hammer now
check wield, hold, and both sheaths.
- Shovel: Added the TOOL-SHOVEL obj flag and converted dig/excavate code to
check for flag instead of vnum. Updated stock shovels.
- Soak: Updated all items that gave Soak bonuses.
- Splint Vambraces: Corrected a typo in the long description.
- Stone hammer: Raised damage slightly, as it's a non-scalable item. Was
incorrectly requiring Basic Crafts. Also fixed a bug where it scaled too high
(it should not have been scaling).

- Trinkets: Now require that you be standing, not sleeping.
- Uncollected loot: Added a new object flag that will cause loot from dead
creatures to decay even on claimed land, if it is never picked up by a player.

converted the wear code to use it.
- Wheat: Fixed the line that said it could be milled into "flower".
- Wolverine fur cap: Now correctly scales.

Major bugs:
- Alternate: Was not checking the account ID correctly on characters not on any
account. You can no longer alternate while editing text.
- Build: Barriers were counting as open spaces for building entrances.
- Burning: Buildings with players inside when they burned down were triggered
infinite loops due to late extraction.
- Chant of Druids: Noskilling Natural Magic will now block this chant from
rewarding skill.
- City Found: Stopped several chore actions in the room when a city is founded,
as this may be the source of actions processing on rooms that don't have valid
results for them.
- Class abilities: Changed how class abilities are applied and removed so that
players do not end up with an outdated set of class abilities, or a class
ability that should have been removed.
- Coins: Fixed a crash bug when the game attempts to charge misc coins to a
player who only has empire coins.
- Distrust from stealth/hostility: Fixed an issue where an empire could become
distrustful with itself, although this had no real meaning.
- Divide by zero: Fixed several places where health/move/mana having a max of 0
would trigger a divide-by-zero segfault.
- Docks: Fixed a bug where players without swim could not enter an unfinished
Docks (or other land-based water building).
- Earthmeld: Some parts of a character were visible in the room when using a
no-see-in-room effect like Earthmeld, due to an improperly placed return.
- Editnotes: Fixed a crash bug in aborting editnotes.
- empty_obj_before_extract: Fixed a bug where a carried item that was emptied
(e.g. by Butcher) called the wrong property and triggered a full crash.
- Follower limits: Players were able to override the NPC follower limit in
several ways. NPCs over the limit will now attack their master.
- Hammers: Fixed a crash bug in the b1.8 hammer change.
- Heal-per-5: Moved the code to the correct place after affect wear-off to
prevent a bonus tick on this affect.
- Health, Move, Mana: Fixed an issue where people able to class below skill
level 75 were seeing huge health/move/mana pools until 75, then dropping back
to 50/100/50.
- Helpsearch: Fixed an overflow issue that really easily crashed the game.
- History: Fixed a crash bug triggered by specific items in the history. Also
fixed its CRLF detection.
- Homes: Deleting a character who had a private home no longer results in a
permanently claimed home marked "someone".
- Infiltrate: Fixed a bug where some players could avoid the members-online and
other stealth checks.
- Interactions: Fixed a bug in b1.8 where non-exclusive interactions were being
treated as mutually exclusive.
- Interactions: Room interactions were always running on the room the character
is in, which was causing a bug in using Devastation Ritual to harvest crops.
- Mob tagging: Fixed a bug where logging off at the right time could result in
untagging a mob.
- Names: Fixed the name validator, which was incorrectly checking for invalid
names.
- Nameserver lookups: Added an option to disable hostname lookups on a per-IP
basis in order to prevent the need to turn off hostname lookup due to one slow
nameserver lagging out the mud.
- Ocean pool: Removed the ocean pool system entirely. It was the cause of a
memory leak which is easily fixed, but that also means the mud has been running
well without the ocean pool functioning.
- OLC: Fixed an issue where low-level immortals trying to edit adventures in a
particular way would cause a full crash.
- Permissions: Fixed a bug where allies could sometimes qualify for
members-only permissions.
- Room templates: Fixed a crash bug caused by null room template descriptions.
- Scripting: Noskill will now block scripts from granting skill gains or
setting skill higher.
- Scripting: Raised the size of the ID space for mobs and rooms in the
scripting system by 10x in order to delay the major fallout that occurs when
they run out of IDs. This will need a larger fix, but on the beta server at
least, 1m IDs took 2-3 days to run out, so 10m should be good for over a week
even on a busy game.
- Slash-channels: Prevented non-alphanumeric and unprintable characters from
being used in slash-channel names.
- Steal: Fixed a bug where some players could avoid the members-online and
other stealth checks.
- Study: Noskilling High Sorcery will now block study from rewarding skill.
- Trade: Fixed a bug where the cancel and check 'trade' subcommands could cause
a crash in the event that there is a purchased-but-uncollected item in the
list.
- Workforce: Finishing chopping, mining, building, or dismantling for a
workforce mob will no longer block it from despawning.

Miscellaneous:
- Shutdowns: The SIGHUP, SIGINT, and SIGTERM signals now trigger a graceful
shutdown instead of a rapid exit.
- Socials: Large number of text fixes in socials, mostly from Steel.

Mobs:
- Aggressive: Mobs flagged AGGRO will now correctly attack citizens (and, in
fact, will attack any human NPC that isn't also aggressive).
- Aquatic: Mobs with the aquatic flag can no longer move on land (unless they
are flying).
- Auto-herd: Mobs who are tied up or incapacitated will no longer auto-herd.
- Autokill: Mobs flagged HARD or GROUP will now autokill (animals usually
don't).
- Blood: Very low-level mobs now have much lower blood pools.
- Bodyguard: Added infravision so bodyguards can assist in dark rooms.
- Charm: Players may no longer give items to charmed NPCs. Charmed mobs can no
longer pick up items.
- Chimpanzees: Are no longer flagged as HUMAN.
- Critters: Added despawn triggers to tiny critters like mice and spiders.
- Emperor of Penguins: Corrected this mob's gender.
- Fin Whale: Corrected typo in long description.
- Gorillas: Are no longer flagged as HUMAN.
- Ground squirrel: Removed hyphen in name.
- Harnessed animals: Fixed a bug where it was possible to move a two-animal
cart while the second animal is in combat; the animal would break combat and
move.
- Loot: Fixed the 'exclusive' interaction flag for loot, which was ignoring it.
- !LOOT flag: This flag now also blocks pickpocket.
- !NPC building flag: This flag no longer functions if the building is
incomplete.
- Scaling: Raised scaled attributes, damage, and health on high-level mobs in
general. Raised to-hit on DPS mobs and dodge on tank mobs. Lowered mob dodge
overall.
- Summoned mobs: No longer able to drop any loot.
- Tagging: Group members who aren't present will no longer automatically tag a
mob. This prevents items from binding to group members who aren't present in
order to bypass the BoP system.
- Wolf: Fixed a typo in the wolf's environmental trigger.
- Workforce: Fixed an issue where the brickmaking chore might spawn a mob when
there is no work to do, in rare cases.

New configs:
- auto_update_items 1
- bound_item_junk_time  10080
- long_autostore: Reduced default to 720 minutes, from 3 days.
- max_chore_resource_over_total 25
- newbie_island_day_limit 7
- npc_follower_limit 6
- num_duplicates_in_stable 2
- public_logins 0
- rogue_flag_time 1440
- summon_npc_limit 5
- war_cost_max 50000
- war_cost_min 5000

OLC:
- Exits: Added a 'change' option for the room template exit editor.
- Interactions: Added a 'change' option for the interaction interface. Fixed a
display bug in adding interactions.
- .map terrain: Removed the extra comma at the start of the terrain list.
- Objects: Fixed a bug in the object auditor where poisons were dropping
through to book audits.
- .removeindev: Added a new OLC command that removes all in-development flags
from a zone or vnum range.
- Resources: Added a 'change' option for the resource list in the craft editor.
- Room template spawns: Added a 'change' option.
- Storage: Object storage locations will now preserve their list order when
opening an object editor. They were inverting the order each time, causing
meaningless changes to the files.

Optimization:
- Instancer: Adjusted the limits on the instancing code in order to prevent
crippling lag.
- Room saving: Skip island lookup on boat rooms, which do not require an island
id anyway.

PHP:
- map-viewer.php: Added 'p' and 'g' shortcut keys to the map viewer page, for
toggling political mode and the grid.

Players:
- Deficits: Added a deficit system for health, mana, and move. This prevents
them from going negative and the deficit will decay as the player regenerates
normally. If they re-equip items while the deficit is present, they will not
get the full boost to their current h/v/m. However, this feature is disabled in
2.0b2 for further testing and fixes with morphed players.
- Health, Move, Mana: Adjusted the way these traits rise with level so that
players start gaining them as soon as they pass skill level 75, with a class.
Previously, they might take several levels more to start rising.
- Promo codes: New characters are now prompted for promo codes when they
create, to help track ads and traffic sources.
- Skill level: Replaced the skill level computation completely. Players are now
considered skill level 100 when they have two level-100 skills and one level-75
skill. All lower levels are now based on percentage of progress to that.

Scripting:
- Blood: Added %actor.blood()% which returns current blood or adds/removes
blood.
- Character variables: Added is_god and is_immortal.
- Color codes: Fixed an issue where color codes starting with ampersands were
getting eaten by the script parser.
- Counterspell: Added %actor.trigger_counterspell%.
- Damage: Raised scripting damage.
- Leave-All: Added a new mob trigger type that ignores inability to see the
player.
- %load%: Added the instance_obj_setup step to the %load% command to ensure
portals loaded by scripts get the correct target.
- Messages: Script messages will no longer be sent to sleeping players.
- Poisons: Added %actor.resist_poison% and %actor.poison_immunity% getters.
- Position: Added %actor.position% getter for character position.
- Resources: Added a 'change' option for the resource list in the craft editor.
- Room template spawns: Added a 'change' option.
- Rooms: Added a room template vnum getter, %room.template%.
- Skill names: Added %skill.name()% to get the full name of an abbreviated
skill.
- Skill resets: Added %actor.give_skill_reset()% function.
- Skill validation: Added %skill.validate()% for verifying user input.
- Text parsing: Fixed an issue where some scripts could miss text parsing and
be unable to use the %str.car% and %str.cdr% in some cases.

A Precarious Ledge~
   You descend into the fissure, following a rock ledge along one wall. You are
immediately struck by the furnace-like heat rising from the magma below, and
your ears are constantly assaulted by a deafening roar. The ledge beneath your
feet slopes gently downward before turning off into a cavern in the rock wall.

The Fiend's Lair~
   You emerge on a narrow ledge in a large, domed cavern. Not far below is a
huge, boiling lake of magma. Ahead of you, a narrow rock bridge slopes downward
to a central pillar, barely elevated above the magma.

bridge rock narrow~
   The bridge is somewhat narrow but thick, formed from a black volcanic stone.
It will not collapse under the weight of a few adventures, and as long as
you're careful you should be able to stay on it.

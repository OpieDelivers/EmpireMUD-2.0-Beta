STEALTH "STEALTH SKILL"

Stealth is the skill tree for all things secret, hidden, or shadow. Little is
known about its practitioners. Rumors swirl of an underground group of thieves
called the Guild, though no one dares confirm them.

(To begin your journey down the path of Stealth, try bribing the hidden guild-
master.)
